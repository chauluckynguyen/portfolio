          I spent an enlightening 3 months with the Experience Organization at ServiceNow. 
          Being it as my first internship, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to hone my 
          design and engineer skills from a talented and creative team while also developing my business acumen. 
          My main project was ServiceNow's first Design System, which you can check out here!
        </p>
        <p className="section--body">
          Even though I was an intern, I immediately felt like I was part of the team, the company, the family. 
          Here, I learned something new almost every day. I was able to contribute in the design process, and 
          I grew into a stronger developer whenever I received critical feedback. I am proud to say that I am 
          still with ServiceNow as a full-time UX engineerÂ :) I can go on and on about my experience, 
          but if you would like to know more, please feel free to reach out to me!
